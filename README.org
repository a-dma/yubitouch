* YubiTouch

A Bash script for setting or clearing touch requests for cryptographic
operations in the OpenPGP application on a *YubiKey 4*

** Note

This tool has been superseded in functionality by [[https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/][YubiKey Manager]]
(currently only the CLI side). However, some people have shown
interest in keeping this script around for ease of use and because of
its smaller surface / fewer dependencies.

* Dependencies

 - gpg-connect-agent
 - pinentry (any kind, optional)

* Usage

Run the tool as:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./yubitouch.sh {sig|aut|dec} {off|on|fix} [admin_pin]
#+END_SRC

where the parameters indicate the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 {sig|aut|dec} Signature, authentication or decryption key
 {off|on|fix}  Value of the option
 [admin_pin]   The Admin PIN of the YubiKey (optional)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If a PIN is provided through the command line, make sure to
escape/quote it if it contains special characters like ~$~.

Setting the touch option to ~fix~ will cause any subsequent invocation
of this script on that same subkey to do nothing. The only way to
reset this is by generating or importing a new key for that slot.

If the Admin PIN is not provided through the command line, the tool
will ask the user for it. If a version of ~pinentry~ is available it
will be used, otherwise it will fall back to reading standard input.

** Personalization advice

To mitigate the fact that this tool needs to interact with the Admin
PIN of a device, it is advisable to run the script after having
generated/imported keys, but /before/ doing the full device
personalization. Specifically, using this tool on a YubiKey that still
has the default Amin PIN (~12345678~) set.
